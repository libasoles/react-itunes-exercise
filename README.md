# What is it?
I'm making this exercise for recruiters consideration. Meaning, to have something to show.

## What it does
Basically, it searches iTunes for albums and artists.

## Technologies
- React (create-react-app)
- Material UI
- Now (CD by Zeit)

## How to run
If you already have node version 10 or greater, just run:
`yarn install && yarn start`

If you are running an oldest version, you can do this instead:
`npx -p node@10 yarn install && yarn start`
